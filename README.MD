# Tell, Don't Ask Code Kata

Code Kata is an exercise, that allows you to train your skills by practice.

## This project

You are starting a miniature, automated farm, that will grow and sell some plants.
Starting with baby steps, at the beginning you want your farm to fulfil three main tasks:
 * water the crops that are organised into Raised Beds
 * gather the crops when they are grown enough
 * sell your products and send them to customers

## Solving Kata

Start with an examination of tests that are provided. 
Basic scenarios are covered there, but you might want to add some tests while refactoring the code.
Feel free to reorganize the project as you are working with it.
There is no single valid solution for this.
